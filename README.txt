Tools:
* p5.js (javascript library)
* node.js (javascript enviroment)
* express.js (javascipt library)

Bugs: 
* trying a snow algorithm to make the "points" look more real was failed.
* Next time use p5.js canvas in a normal website using html and css.

Result:
* This project was a test for myself to learn p5.js to render on the website.
* Turned out good, except the render problems on the texts making spikes on the text.
